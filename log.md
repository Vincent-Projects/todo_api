# Log for the API

## 17 January, 2021

I start logging to get a journal of my thought throughout the development of this app, which i think will help me create real product.
I use Nodejs because i want to master Javascript i'm a believer in this technology and i needed a server side language. I discoverd about Nodejs month ago as well as it best framework, Expressjs.
Today i installed express-validor to secure the user input and help prevent from attack like man-in-the-middle attack. It'll handle check, sanitization, and validation.
I added validation with express-validator to the login middleware. And i added a server side error middleware to handle errors better ( til now it was only logging to the console the errors )
